            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>I used most of my time focusing on improving this assignment since I felt that this was the one needed the most work. 
                The first thing I did was removing some of the CSS drawings and replacing them with svgs. This made it easier to make it look more like the poster and responsiveness.
                The whole code was really messy so i made many changes to make it clean. I used the methods we learned in class, like DRY ( Don't Repeat Yourself ), KISS ( Keep it simple stupid ) and YAGNI ( You ain't gonna need it ). 
                A lot of the classes had some unnecessary names or unspecific names. So I change to make it so that it made more sense and was easier to understand. I change the font to the correct one. I got the right font from a friend who found it one the internet. 
                One thing I did that I would change it I had time was not using br for the text and instead use another method to make the text look the same as the poster. One thing I would ad as well is more of different animations. 
                On this assignment I originally worked with Emilie Rolstad.
