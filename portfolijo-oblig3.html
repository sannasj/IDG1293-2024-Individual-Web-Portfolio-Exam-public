        <div>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>The first thing I did was implement reduced motion. I made an @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) media query. I made so that the frogs ease in on the screen instead of jumping. I also fixed the text so it is the same size. 
                There were some more thing that I would like to fix, but I didn’t have enough time. The first thigh I would like to do is making it responsive. The elements are scalable but the background stays the same. I tried to fix it but it didn’t work the way I wanted. The second thing is making the svgs disappear when you scroll down. Example: so that the pond don’t just fly up in the air. 
                I feel like there is lot you can do with the code. The CSS is very long and you could probably shorten it down by using DRY ( Don't Repeat Yourself ), KISS ( Keep it simple stupid ) and YAGNI ( You ain't gonna need it ).
                On this assignment I worked originally with Kaja Emilie Berg and Toril Hokseggen.
